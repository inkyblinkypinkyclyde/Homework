I have submitted a class diagram.

This shows the gardner-plant-bed relationship.

As demonstrated in my diagram, The gardener has a series of attributes:
Name, which is a sting
height, which is an integer
number_of_trowels, which is an integer
plants which is an empty list

the methods which can becalled on the gardner are:
plant_plant which has the parameters plant and bed
total_plants has no additional parameters because it is called on the object itself but it does return an integer
dig_over_bed which resets the number of plants in a bed to 0. This returns nothing but does take the parameter bed.

Bed has no methods but does have the attributes Location, area and plants (which is a list).

Plant has the attributes family, species and age. It has one method which will increment the age attribute by one day (when it is written)
