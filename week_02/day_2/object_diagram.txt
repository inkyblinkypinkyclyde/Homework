I have submitted an object diagram of gardner-plant-bed program.

This includes the Gardener object who's name is Otto. He is 200cm tall and has many(500) trowels. He can have plants but at the moment it's an empty list.

The bed object is showing the Under Tree Bed which has location, area and plants as properties.

The Plant shows the Broccoli object which has a family, species and age property.

I am not a gardener.
